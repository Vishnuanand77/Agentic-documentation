_**Assistant**_

Looking at the git output, I can see that there's an issue with the git configuration. The system is trying to commit changes but it's not finding the user's git configuration. This is evident from these specific lines:

```
2025-03-22 12:35:37.501 [info] > git config --get-all user.name [9ms]
2025-03-22 12:35:37.510 [info] > git config --get-all user.email [9ms]
```

The system is checking for git user configuration (name and email) but appears to be getting no response. This means your git user identity hasn't been configured yet, which is required for making commits.

To fix this, you need to set up your git configuration with your name and email. You can do this by running these commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Would you like me to help you set up your git configuration?
