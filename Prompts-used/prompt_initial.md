## Prompt 1
prompt 1 = I want to create documentation in the following fashion:

Frontend-high-level.md: covers all webpages with high level overview
Frontend-low-level.md: Gets all webpages names from frontend-high-level.md and add details such as key components, key interactions, all api calls. Don't mention obvious elements such as submit button, or interactions. 
Backend-high-level.md: covers all webpages with high level overview
Backend-low-level.md: Get all api calls and add key details.

## Prompt 2
prompt 2 = can you create a readme.md file as well. Include details of how this project was created with AI and the steps I took to create this project. Then include how others can run this project locally.


## Improvements to be made
- Verify documentation, make it ask questions
- Close existing git repo
- Include mermaid diagram
- Use stepwise prompt
