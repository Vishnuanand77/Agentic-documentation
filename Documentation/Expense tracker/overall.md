# Expense Tracker - Overall Documentation

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The Expense Tracker is a web application designed to help users manage and track their expenses. It provides features for adding, viewing, and analyzing expenses with visual representations through charts and graphs.

### Key Features
- Expense creation and management
- Category-based expense tracking
- Monthly expense visualization
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Secure user authentication
- Responsive design for all devices

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js 13+ with App Router
- React for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Axios for API communication

### Backend
- Node.js/Express.js server
- RESTful API architecture
- Prisma ORM for database operations
- JWT for authentication
- SQL database

## System Architecture

    C --> D[(SQL Database)]
    B --> E[Chart.js]
    C --> F[JWT Auth]
    C --> G[Prisma ORM]
```

## Data Flow
1. User interacts with frontend interface
2. Frontend makes authenticated API calls
3. Backend validates requests and processes data
4. Database operations performed via Prisma
5. Results returned to frontend
6. UI updated with new data

## Security Implementation
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure API endpoints
- Input validation
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Secure token storage

## Deployment Architecture
- Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
- Backend: Node.js hosting (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean)
- Database: Managed SQL service
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

## Development Workflow
1. Local development setup
2. Feature development
3. Testing
4. Code review
5. Deployment to staging
6. Production deployment
